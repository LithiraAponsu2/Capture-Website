# Packet Capture and Analysis Software for Windows

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Windows software application using Flutter for capturing and analyzing network packets generated during a single web search. The software provides a user-friendly interface to initiate packet capture, visualize captured data, and perform basic analysis on network traffic.

## Features
- **Packet Capture**: Capture network packets generated during a single web search session.
- **Live Packet Visualization**: Display real-time visualization of captured packets, including packet size, source/destination addresses, and protocols.
- **Packet Filtering**: Implement filtering mechanisms to focus on packets relevant to the web search session.
- **Basic Analysis**: Perform basic analysis on captured packets, such as identifying HTTP requests/responses and analyzing packet timing.

## Theories and Technologies Used
- **TShark**: Tshark terminal app used for packet capture functionality.
- **Flutter**: Develop the graphical user interface (GUI) using Flutter, a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Usage
1. **Start Capture**: Initiate packet capture session by clicking the "Start Capture" button.
2. **Perform Web Search**: Conduct a web search within the software or use an external web browser.
3. **Capture Analysis**: View real-time visualization of captured packets and perform basic analysis on captured data.
4. **Stop Capture**: End packet capture session and review captured packet data.
